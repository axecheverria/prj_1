This project allows you to download mp3 files from YouTube with the correct metadata through the use of various APIs. 

An example use case is to let the user input a YouTube URL into a form in the project's web page.
After the user has pasted the URL and has pressed "convert", a link to a downloadable mp3 file will be available for the user.

The downloaded mp3 file will have the correct metadata for the requested YouTube URL.

E.g., if a user enters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpGp-22t0lU
The output will be a downloadable link to an mp3 file with metadata:

Title:  Atlas
Artist: Battles
Album:  Mirrored

and so on.

Future features:
	. The ability to pull songs from SoundCloud (with the correct metadata as well)
	. Getting the album art and including it with the mp3 file
