Project 1: YouTube to MP3
=========================

This project allows you to extract mp3 files from YouTube videos through the use of various APIs. 

The mp3 files contain the metadata for the artist, track name, album name, and musical genre. In addition, the mp3 file will have its associated album art included.

####Usage
Input a YouTube URL for a song into the form in the project's <a href="http://downloader-proj.herokuapp.com/" title="Project 1", target="_blank">web page</a>.

After pressing `GO`, a link to a downloadable mp3 file will be available.

E.g., on entering: 

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Blfi00qCQs4

the output will be a downloadable link to an mp3 file with the following metadata:

    Title:  TRAS 3
    Artist: Battles
    Album:  B EP
    Genre:  Math Rock

####Planned features
* The ability to pull songs from SoundCloud (with the correct metadata as well)
